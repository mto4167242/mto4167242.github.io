      <h3>Kruje</h3>
	  <p class="subtext"> The center of Skanderbeg's rebellion against the Ottomans. </p>
      <p>Located only 20 km north of Tirana, the town of Kruje is located between the mountain in which it derives its name from, and the Ishem River. This town was the center of the Albanian people in ancient times being named Albanopolis.The town has seen many sieges in medieval times, being within the passing point of large empires such as the Byzantines, Serbians and Ottomans. From the castle, Skanderbeg and his men defended the town against not just one, but four seperate Ottoman sieges. The National Museum Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu honors the hero, through a masterful mixture of history, architecture and art. The museum boasts an impressive wall of statues which shows Skanderbeg along with his loyal warriors, among them, his wife.</p>

      <h3>Tirana</h3>
	  <p class="subtext"> Home to the National Museum of History, containing historical weapons and armor. </p>
      <p>The capital of Albania, it is home to buildings that have stood through a great deal of history. However, Skanderbeg Square is surprisingly modern. Created the early 20th century, its construction followed the toppling of the Albanian Monarchy and institution of communism. The Old Bazaar was detonated to be replaced by a square with a statue of Joseph Stalin in the center. When communism fell in 1991, the statue would be removed following student-led protests. Now, the center is dominated by the Skanderbeg Monument, which was erected in 1968 to commemorate 500 years since his death. It is also home to Europe Park, and surrounded by important institutions such as the Bank of Albania, City Hall, Palace of Culture, and the National History museum which contains his helmet and sword.</p>

      <h3>Lezhe</h3>
	  <p class="subtext"> Where great minds gathered not to weather the storm, but cut through it. </p>
      <p>In ancient sources, the city is dubbed "Lissos". This city was one of the main fortifications of the Illyrian people in the battles against the Macedonians and Romans, and a key strategic location. Its reputation as such would still hold true in the XV century as being under Venetian control, it served as a neutral ground in the Albanian-Ottoman conflict. Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg decided upon using this location as the place of convention for the Albanian nobles and generals to formulate and organize their defense against the Turkish invasion. It is now home to the grave of Skanderbeg which is watched over by Lezhe Castle upon the hill. His place of burial once was a cathedral dedicated to Saint Nicholas, which was converted to the Selimie Mosque, and now it has once again returned to its original form.</p>
