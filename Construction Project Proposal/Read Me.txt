This project was part of a final group presentation on a mock project proposal pitched in front of a real audience
in a banquet hall. It was part of a construction and drafting extracurricular course known as the ACE program. 
Using the drafting program SketchUp, I created the virtual renders on the tenth page.
I also created the images of the internal lobby.
